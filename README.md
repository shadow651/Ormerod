Ormerod
=======

Fork of RepRapPro Ormerod 3D printer design files.
This branch will be maintained with the v528.4 files.

Files will also be converted from Solidworks files to .step files to encourage open source development/evolution of Ormerod 2 parts.
If a file has not yet been converted to .step and you need it to be, open an issue and I will get to it as soon as possible.
Step isn't ideal, as some solidworks stuff will be lost, but it will at least give a good geometric CAD shape of the final parts. This should be sufficient for a starting point of most modifications

Dev Branch and Main Branch will be kept up to date with RepRapPro's version.
I also intend to convert these solidworks files to .step as well in the future.
