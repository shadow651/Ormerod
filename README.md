Ormerod
=======

Fork of RepRapPro Ormerod 3D printer design files.
This branch will be maintained with the v528.4 files.

Files will also be converted from Solidworks files to .obj files to encourage open source development/evolution of Ormerod 2 parts.
If a file has not yet been converted to .obj and you need it to be, open an issue and I will get to it as soon as possible.


Dev Branch and Main Branch will be kept upto date with RepRapPro's version.
I also intend to convert these solidworks files to .obj's as well
